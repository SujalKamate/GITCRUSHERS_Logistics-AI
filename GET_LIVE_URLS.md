# 🌍 Get Your Logistics AI System Live - Public URLs

## 🎯 Goal: Deploy and Get Working Links

Transform your local Logistics AI system into a live, publicly accessible application with these URLs:

- **📊 Dashboard**: `https://your-app.vercel.app` (Logistics team interface)
- **📱 Customer App**: `https://your-api.railway.app/customer-app/` (Customer requests)
- **🚛 Driver App**: `https://your-api.railway.app/driver-app/` (Driver notifications)

## 🚀 Fastest Path to Live URLs (30 minutes)

### Option 1: Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
python deploy_live.py
```
This script will:
- ✅ Check your code is ready
- ✅ Guide you through Railway deployment (API)
- ✅ Guide you through Vercel deployment (Frontend)
- ✅ Test all services
- ✅ Give you working URLs

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step
```bash
python deploy.py
```
Choose option 1 (Railway + Vercel) and follow the instructions.

## 📋 What You Need

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code needs to be on GitHub
2. **Groq API Key** - Free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/keys)
3. **30 minutes** - Time to complete deployment

## 🔧 Alternative Deployment Options

### Docker (Local Production)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
- Runs locally with production setup
- Includes Redis, Nginx, SSL

- Good for production use

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Git repository not found"**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **"Build failed"**
   - Check Python version is 3.11+
   - Verify all files are committed
   - Check requirements.txt exists

3. **"CORS errors"**
   - Update CORS_ORIGINS environment variable
   - Add your frontend domain to allowed origins

4. **"API not responding"**
   - Check GROQ_API_KEY is set correctly
   - Verify health endpoint: `/health`
   - Check deployment logs

### Test Your Deployment:
```bash
python check_deployment.py
```

## 📈 Scaling & Costs

### Free Tier Limits:
- **Railway**: 500 hours/month, 1GB RAM
- **Vercel**: 100GB bandwidth, unlimited requests

### When to Upgrade:
- **High traffic**: Upgrade to paid tiers
