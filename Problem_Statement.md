🧩 Problem Statement – Broken into Easy Points
1️⃣ Logistics decisions are static
Today, routes and loads are decided once at the start

After that, the plan is fixed, even if conditions change

👉 This does not match real-world operations

2️⃣ Real-world conditions keep changing continuously
Traffic congestion

Fuel price fluctuations

Delivery delays

New load requests appearing mid‑journey

👉 But current systems do not react to these changes

3️⃣ Trucks are already in motion when problems occur
Decisions need to be made while trucks are moving

Not before the trip, not after the trip

👉 This is the core challenge: mid‑journey decision-making

4️⃣ This leads to inefficiency and losses
Trucks travel partially empty

Trucks return empty

Drivers wait idle

Fuel and time are wasted

👉 Profitability and utilization drop significantly

5️⃣ Drivers and fleet operators face different but connected problems
Drivers: uncertain income, idle hours

Fleet operators: hard to coordinate multiple trucks at different locations and stages

👉 One decision affects the whole system

6️⃣ The problem is NOT just routing
Routing solves “how to go from A to B”

The real issue is what should the truck do next, given current conditions

👉 This is a decision problem, not just a path problem

7️⃣ Logistics should be treated as a continuous process
Not isolated trips

But a system that keeps observing and updating decisions

👉 Think of logistics as a living, evolving operation

8️⃣ What kind of solution is required (problem expectation)
The problem demands a system that:

Continuously observes live conditions

Thinks ahead about future outcomes

Balances profit, time, capacity, and constraints

Supports both individual trucks and the entire fleet
